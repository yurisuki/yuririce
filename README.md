# introduction
This rice is the one I use currently on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/), and it's highly dependant on [voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice) by [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA) with huge modifications I made to make it comfy as much as possible.

You also update my dotfiles by running the script again.
