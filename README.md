# introduction
This rice is the one I use currently on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/), and it's highly dependant on [voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice) by [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA) with huge modifications I made to make it comfy as much as possible

### additional
My rice uses Czech keyboard layout, so you might want to change it.
```
# Change keyboard layout to English
rm ~/.scripts/tools/remaps
mv ~/.scripts/tools/remaps_ ~/.scripts/tools/remaps
#
# Change locale to English
sed -i 's/cs_CZ/en_US/g' ~/.bashrc
```
You might change browser to something else, because you don't like Firefox
```
sed -i 's/firefox/chromium/g' ~/.profile
# Replace "chromium" with any browser of your choice (that browser has to be installed) or leave "firefox" if you want firefox.
```
# todo/goals
- Get independent of Luke Smith's rice (shouldn't be that hard if I wasn't lazy that much as I'm right now)

You can also help me achieve my goals by contibuting to my GitHub repository by using pull requests and issues (if any bug occurs.)

# faq
What wallpaper do you currently use?
- I've got my FTP server, where I have my website. I made a ["script"](https://github.com/yurisuki/yuririce/commit/9e8907be6809b99f8402d239e4f2b8a1079bfd26) which automatically uploades my wallpaper whenever I change my wallpaper to that FTP server, and in the result, I can view my wallpaper from anywhere and use it as my [New tab page](http://yuri.rf.gd/newpage/).
