- make my own vim script, i dont need all that stuff, that is in current config
- put screenshot somewhere else, so it doesnt take space
- move emoji files (they're in .config), and i think .local is good dir for them.
- use mpd for music thats on machine.
- make some script for managing my dotfiles, currently i move all files that i edit to cloned git directory, thats taking my time uselessly.
- scripts and i3blocks cleanup.
- add uptime, and other system resources in fetch script
- latex templates
- firefox config in repo


i would do this rn, but my time is limited unfortunentely.
